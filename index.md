## Lab 1: Artemis

### Downloading and Installing the Arduino IDE

I already had this installed on my computer from past projects, so I largely skipped this step. However, I tried installing this on VSCode (my favorite editor so far) and ran into [problems that would require a downgrade of my IDEs](https://arduino.stackexchange.com/questions/74881/error-messages-while-verifying-code-with-visual-studio-code). I chose to stick with the course instructions and use the official Arduino IDE, but I may look into better IDE options later if the coursework is intense enough that the work to install a better IDE would be worth it.

### Installing the Board Manager
The installation is identical to the [supplied instructions](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/artemis-development-with-arduino?_ga=2.30055167.1151850962.1594648676-1889762036.1574524297&_gac=1.19903818.1593457111.Cj0KCQjwoub3BRC6ARIsABGhnyahkG7hU2v-0bSiAeprvZ7c9v0XEKYdVHIIi_-J-m5YLdDBMc2P_goaAtA4EALw_wcB), except any reference to the "Artemis board" should refer to the "Artemis Nano" board to reflect the class-supplied kit. Similarly, some of the [numbers of the examples](https://cei-lab.github.io/ECE4960-2022/Lab1.html) have changed, but their content remains the same.
