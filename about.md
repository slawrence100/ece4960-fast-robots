## About Me
I'm Syd Lawrence (he/him), a Computer Science major at Cornell Engineering. I've taken a few classes on robots so far, and I've been involved in project teams and other organizations doing robotics work. I'm hoping to use this class as a fun and practical way to complete the robotics minor.
